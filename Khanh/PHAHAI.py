Suppose that there were two files of Python code stored in the file File1.py and File2.py respectively. The file content is shown in the figure below. What will be the output if we run File2.py?
#  File1.py
print("File1 name =%s" % _name

 if ___main__ == "__main__"
 print("File1 is being run directly")
else: 
print("File1 is being imported")
